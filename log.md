# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 2, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through Packages and Function in tour.golang.com.

**Thoughts** Nothing new on this day but i totaly forgot about Named return values.


### Day 2: May 3, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through For, IF, Swith statements in tour.golang.com.

**Thoughts** I didn't know unlike C and PHP, Go only runs the selected case, not all the cases that follow.

### Day 3: May 4, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through Pointers and structs in tour.golang.com.

**Thoughts** Nothing new on this day but it was good to read documentations about the Go Pointers.
